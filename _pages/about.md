I am a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics and Data Science at University of Texas Health Science Center and a Ph.D. trainee at MD Anderson Cancer Center, supervised by [Professor Ryan Sun](https://ryanrsun.github.io./). I received my BS in Pharmaceutical Engineering from Southeast University and my MS in Biostatistics from New York University.

My research interests lie in developing statistical models that deepen our understanding of how genetics influence disease. My work focuses on making these models more robust and applicable to real-world, large-scale genetic data. I am also interested in bayesian analysis and its application in clinical trials.

In my free time, I enjoy movies (favorite directors of all time: Éric Rohmer, Hong Sang-soo, Hamaguchi Ryūsuke) and music (favorite musician in recent years: Sheena Ringo), tennis, swimming and playing with cats.
