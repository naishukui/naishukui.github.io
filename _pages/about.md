I am a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics and Data Science at University of Texas Health Science Center and a Ph.D. trainee at MD Anderson Cancer Center, supervised by [Professor Ryan Sun](https://ryanrsun.github.io./). I received my BS in Pharmaceutical Engineering from Southeast University and my MS in Biostatistics from New York University.

My research interests lie in developing novel statistical methodology to understand the genetic basis of complex diseases.

In my free time, I enjoy movies (favorite directors of all time: Éric Rohmer, Hong Sang-soo, Hamaguchi Ryūsuke) and music (favorite musician in recent years: Sheena Ringo), tennis and swimming.
